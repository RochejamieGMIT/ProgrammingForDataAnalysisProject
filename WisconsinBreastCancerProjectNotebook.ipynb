    "This data set is a data set based on the work of Dr. William H. Wolberg, in University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison last revised on Nov 22,1991. The data was comprised of on going research, so the data was added in intervals, broken in to groups. \n",

In the bayesian network model there is no node connected to itself or no loops between nodes occur. This machine learning model is based on Bayes theorem:\n",

    "This paper use multiple data sets, including the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set . This paper also uses quite a few data analysis techniques. The first technique is the CART Algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Classification And Regression Tree (CART) is a another machine learning technique where decision trees are used to predict a target variable using predictor variables in the decison tree. The CART method determines a best point to split the input, it then continues splititng the input until all spliting is complete or until a limit is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the CART method, the outcome was predictied with 94.84% accuracy. This took a decision tree size of 15 to complete all the splitting until the best results were reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective method for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set in this paper is the Principal Components Attribute Evaluation, achieving an accuracy of 96.99% with a decision tree of 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Evaluation is a machine learning technique that converts correlated data points in to lineraly uncorrelated features using orthogonal transformation. Principal Component Evaluation investigates the variance of the data points, data points with high varience are a good point in which to split the data. \n",

In the first paper reviewed the authors used a  bayesian network, in this paper the authors used Na誰ve Bayes. The difference between these 2 methods is bayesian networks are models the relationship between data points more generally, a Na誰ve Bayes classifier is a specific subcategory of the bayesian network.
